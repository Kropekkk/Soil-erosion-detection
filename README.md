# Soil erosion detection
 
## Dependencies
This project will be trained soon on Mask Rcnn(Due to time limit best approach)

1. Create virtual environment ```python -m venv enviro```
2. Activate the virtual environment```.\enviro\Scripts\activate```
3. Install dependencies ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

How to detect deforestation using satellite image data. 
[Amazon deforestation]( https://github.com/ncondo/amazon-from-space)


I think It is important to collect a larger databse of satellite images of soil erosion.
As there were very few images with mask on, I have not trained a very effective model.
